#Helloüôè
I'm Aarav Arya, studying in 8th grade in DPS, Navi Mumbai. 
I have been taking Coding Classes since last week of July.
This is my most recent and the most favourite game I've coded till now.
I like this game very much because of the slingshot skills that's used to play it. Also I'm a big fan of Angry Birds and I've taken inspiration from that game itself and gave it my touch. 
Since Christmas is quite around the corner and I love the festive spirit I thought of including that festive mood in my game also.
I hope that you enjoy the game and that after playing the game even you all are excited about the last week of December.
With Christmas spirit high 
and Santa also in the sky..
But the gifts are in the air, 
with many thieves around beware..
Stop them by testing your aim,
For it will help you win the game..
